## Welcome!

I'm Vinni  
I combine hands-on experiments with computational models to uncover patterns in biological systems.

My interests lies broadly in any area related to the **biomedical field**, particularly where experimental biology and data-driven methods come together.
Specifically in area of 

- Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)
- Virology
- Cancer Biology
- Computational Biology

Whether it's pipetting samples or writing Python scripts, I love building tools that help data and experiments echo each other.  
Currently, I work at **CMS College Kottayam** with Dr. Vibin Ipe Thomas, where I focus on computational analysis and machine learning to predict host-virus interactions.

Explore my [Publications](/publications/), [Tools](/tools/), or [CV](/cv/). I'm always open to collaborations and conversations!

As someone just starting out in this field, I'm actively exploring new ideas, learning new tools, and looking for **PhD opportunities** where I can grow as a scientist and contribute meaningfully to research in human health and disease.
